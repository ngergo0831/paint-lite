# Interview task

## User story
The user would like to use a simple paint program. This program must be accessible from the web browser without the need of installing any other additional software or browser plugin on the machine. 

The user would like to draw lines and rectangles. She/he feels it would be the most comfortable to draw using the mouse: pressing down the left mouse button would start drawing, dragging then releasing would complete the drawing of the selected shape.

User claims (s)he usually needs to change the sketch after the shapes are put down. To delete the selected shapes, the user would like to use the 'Delete' key on the keyboard. To move the selected shapes, the mouse should be supported.

## Technical input
Requirements and notes:

- Use typescript

- You are allowed to use any 3rd party library or framework

- The application must be easily extendible with other shapes and tools - think of architecture not only code.

- Give deployment instructions
